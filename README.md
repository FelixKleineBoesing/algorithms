Dijkstra-algorithm

The Dijsktra algorithm finds the shortest path with a given start node. It belongs to the class of Greedy algorithms, because the node that promises the shortest path from the start node is selected iteratively. 

The Dijkstra algorithm always finds the optimal solution under the assumption of non-negative edge weights. This is based on the assumption that the shortest distances together form the shortest path from source to target. This can be proven by assuming that you did not find the shortest path. If you subsequently found a shorter path, you would also have had to examine its subpaths and therefore there is no shorter path.
